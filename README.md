Thinking about helping this app grow?

Here's what you can do:

* Write an idea to integrate in the app [here](https://github.com/popox/ShotHere/issues)
* Code a new feature. Fork, Branch, Pull request..
* Promote the app to your friends. Talk about it, share it and use it!
* Eat an Oreo. Because that's always a good thing to do
* [Buy me a beer](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=QHK6TMG66TSD4). If ever you like the project
* Help someone in need. I'm sure you'll find someone to help
